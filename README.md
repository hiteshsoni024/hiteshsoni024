## Hi there, I'm Hitesh 👋

🎓 Pre- final Year of B.Tech in Electronics and Communication Engineering @ IIIT Nagpur
🔍 Passionate about **Core Electronics** & exploring the depth of it.

🔭 I’m currently working on ...
  - Hardware Description Language (Verilog) 
  Designing logic modules like multiplexers, ALUs, FSMs(furture steps) and much more using structural and behavioural Verilog. Practicing on HDLBits and building custom testbenches for simulation and debugging.
    
  - RTL Designing & Testbenches
     Creating synthesizable RTL blocks and validating them througth Waveforms and testbenches. Focused on clean modular design and verification flow.
  - Antenna Designing
     Actively taking interest in Antenna Designing in these days.

🛠️ Working Tools
  - HDL (Verilog) -> Using Vivado 2024.2 , EDA Playground
  - RTL Designing & testbenches -> Using Vivado and GTKWave.
  - Antenna Designing -> CST studio suite 2019
  
## 🚀 Projects

🔐 RF-Based Secure Audio Communication System (MATLAB Simulink)
Designed and simulated an end-to-end secure analog communication system using RF transmission. Implemented encryption/decryption using XOR logic for audio signals. Developed both transmitter and receiver chains in Simulink, focusing on modulation, channel modeling, and secure analog data recovery.

🌐 IIITN Website Development – Inter-College Competition (4th Place Winner)
Participated in a web development competition focused on redesigning the official website of IIIT Nagpur. Collaborated with a team to enhance UI/UX, improve code structure, and implement responsive layouts using modern web technologies. Secured 4th position among multiple competing teams, demonstrating effective teamwork and frontend development skills under time-bound constraints.
