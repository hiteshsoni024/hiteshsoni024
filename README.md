# Hi there, I'm Hitesh Soni 👋

🎓 I'm a pre-final year Electronics and Communication Engineering student at **IIIT Nagpur**.
💡 Passionate about digital logic and VLSI, I enjoy building complex systems from the ground up, starting from the transistor level.

### 🛠️ My Tech Stack

| **Domain** | **Technologies & Tools** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **HDLs** | `Verilog` `VHDL` |
| **VLSI Tools** | `Xilinx Vivado` `GTKWave` `EDA Playground` `ModelSim` |
| **System Design** | `MATLAB Simulink` `CST Studio Suite` |
| **Programming** | `C` `Python` `JavaScript` |

### 🌱 I’m currently focused on:

-   **Hardware Description (Verilog):**
    -   Designing and implementing combinational and sequential logic circuits (e.g., ALUs, FSMs).
    -   Writing robust, synthesizable code and practicing verification on platforms like HDLBits.
-   **RTL Design & Verification:**
    -   Developing clean, modular RTL blocks and creating custom testbenches for thorough validation.
    -   Analyzing waveforms to debug and ensure functional correctness.
-   **Antenna Design:**
    -   Exploring simulation and analysis of various antenna types using CST Studio Suite.
